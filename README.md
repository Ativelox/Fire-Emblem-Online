# Fire Emblem Online

Fire Emblem Online (FEO) is a fantasy tactical role-playing game which, as the name suggests, is based off of the game franchise [Fire Emblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem). More specifically it is based off of the GBA Titles of the franchise, featuring mechanics from:
- Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade (FE6)
- Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade (FE7)
- Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones (FE8)

## What To Expect
This game features a wide variety of play styles, some of which aren't present in the franchise, including (but not limited to):
- Online Play (co-op, PvP, PvPvP, etc.)
- Offline Play (co-op, vs. AI)
- Campaign (relive some of the original story)

Additionally it features a Map Editor and the ability to customize your own team using characters present throughout FE6 - FE8 and even more. For some looks at the game itself be sure to check the [wiki](https://github.com/Ativelox/Fire-Emblem-Online/wiki).
